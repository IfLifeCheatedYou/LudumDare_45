Ludum Dare 45 - Start with nothing

You don’t start with nothing, but you start with just a tiny drop of ink left in your ink container.
Draw lines to progress forward. The more distance you reach the more ink you will have available in your next run. 
While progressing make use of the power ups and try to use the rubber bands in your advantage. 
They might backfire! Oh, and avoid the inkblots. Sell your ink for a little boost at the start or unlock new balls with different behaviours.



This was our first Ludum Dare. Even though we had some struggle finding a suitable game concept for the theme “start with nothing” we decided to go with our best idea after a good amount of uneventful brainstorming.
